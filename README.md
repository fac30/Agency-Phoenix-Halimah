# FAC30B Markup Module Project

Halimah and Phoenix's project for the markup module, designing a website for a translation agency.

## Core Stories 
### As a potential client, I want to:

- See information about each member of your team so that I can know who you are
- Browse your website on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- Click to navigate to different sections of your webpage
- Contact you to enquire about working with you
- Visit your website at a publicly accessible domain name

### Additionally, as a visually impaired user, I want to:

- Navigate your website using keyboard controls
- Hear my screen reader describe the content on your website


## Acceptance Criteria 
### User stories come with acceptance criteria - a detailed scope of a user’s requirements.

- Navigation menu
- ‘About us’ section
- Contact form
- A user cannot submit a form without filling out all of the mandatory fields (name, company name, email address)
- Information from the form doesn’t get submitted until the user clicks a button
